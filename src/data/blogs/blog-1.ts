    <p>We're excited to announce our new Slack integration that brings RecapGo's AI-powered meeting insights directly into your team's communication hub. This integration represents a significant step forward in making meeting intelligence more accessible and actionable for teams everywhere.</p>
    
    <h1>Major Announcement: Revolutionary Features</h1>
    <p>This is how a main header (H1) looks in our blog posts. It's bold, prominent, and captures attention while maintaining excellent readability across all devices.</p>
    
    <h2>What's New with the Slack Integration</h2>
    <p>The RecapGo Slack app automatically shares meeting summaries, action items, and key insights in designated channels or as direct messages. This means your team can stay informed about important decisions and follow-ups without having to dig through meeting recordings or lengthy notes.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <p>Our integration comes packed with powerful features designed to streamline your workflow:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automatic Summary Sharing:</strong> Meeting summaries are posted to your chosen Slack channels immediately after each meeting</li>
      <li><strong>Action Item Tracking:</strong> Important tasks and decisions are highlighted and can be converted into Slack reminders</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Notifications:</strong> Get notified about meetings you missed with personalized summaries</li>
      <li><strong>Searchable History:</strong> All meeting insights become searchable within Slack</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Integrations:</strong> Connect with your existing tools and workflows seamlessly</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Implementation Steps</h2>
