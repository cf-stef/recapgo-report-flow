      description: "Discover how our new Slack integration streamlines your meeting workflow and keeps your team connected with AI-powered insights.",
      content: `
        <p>We're excited to announce our new Slack integration that brings RecapGo's AI-powered meeting insights directly into your team's communication hub. This integration represents a significant step forward in making meeting intelligence more accessible and actionable for teams everywhere.</p>
        
        <h1>Major Announcement: Revolutionary Features</h1>
        <p>This is how a main header (H1) looks in our blog posts. It's bold, prominent, and captures attention while maintaining excellent readability across all devices.</p>
        
        <h2>What's New with the Slack Integration</h2>
        <p>The RecapGo Slack app automatically shares meeting summaries, action items, and key insights in designated channels or as direct messages. This means your team can stay informed about important decisions and follow-ups without having to dig through meeting recordings or lengthy notes.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <p>Our integration comes packed with powerful features designed to streamline your workflow:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automatic Summary Sharing:</strong> Meeting summaries are posted to your chosen Slack channels immediately after each meeting</li>
          <li><strong>Action Item Tracking:</strong> Important tasks and decisions are highlighted and can be converted into Slack reminders</li>
          <li><strong>Smart Notifications:</strong> Get notified about meetings you missed with personalized summaries</li>
          <li><strong>Searchable History:</strong> All meeting insights become searchable within Slack</li>
          <li><strong>Custom Integrations:</strong> Connect with your existing tools and workflows seamlessly</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Implementation Steps</h2>
        <p>Getting started is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps:</p>

      description: "Learn how artificial intelligence is transforming the way we capture, analyze, and act on meeting insights.",
      content: `
        <p>Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing how we approach meeting productivity. Gone are the days of frantically taking notes or trying to remember every detail discussed. AI-powered meeting summaries are changing the game.</p>
        
        <h2>The Problem with Traditional Meeting Notes</h2>
        <p>Traditional note-taking during meetings has several limitations: it's time-consuming, often incomplete, and can distract from active participation. Important details get missed, action items are forgotten, and valuable insights are lost.</p>
        
        <h2>How AI Changes Everything</h2>
        <p>AI-powered meeting summaries use natural language processing to automatically capture, analyze, and organize meeting content. This technology can identify key topics, extract action items, and highlight important decisions without human intervention.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Benefits:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Complete Accuracy:</strong> AI captures every word and nuance</li>
          <li><strong>Automatic Organization:</strong> Content is structured into logical sections</li>
          <li><strong>Action Item Extraction:</strong> Tasks and deadlines are automatically identified</li>
          <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Understanding the tone and mood of discussions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The Future of Work</h2>
        <p>As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated features like real-time language translation, automated follow-up scheduling, and predictive insights based on meeting patterns.</p>

      content: `
        <p>Remote work has become the new normal, and with it comes the challenge of running effective virtual meetings. Here are ten proven strategies to make your remote meetings more engaging and productive.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Set Clear Agendas</h2>
        <p>Always send a detailed agenda 24 hours before the meeting. This helps participants prepare and ensures everyone knows what to expect.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Use Video When Possible</h2>
        <p>Video calls create a more personal connection and help maintain engagement. Encourage participants to turn on their cameras.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Keep Meetings Short and Focused</h2>
        <p>Aim for 30-minute meetings maximum. If you need longer, build in breaks every 30 minutes.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Start with a Check-in</h2>
        <p>Begin each meeting with a quick personal check-in to build rapport and ensure everyone is present mentally.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Use Interactive Tools</h2>
        <p>Leverage polls, breakout rooms, and collaborative documents to keep everyone engaged.</p>
        
        <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Mute when not speaking</li>
          <li>Use good lighting and audio equipment</li>
          <li>Record sessions for those who can't attend</li>
          <li>Follow up with clear action items</li>
          <li>Respect time zones when scheduling</li>
